# EMpeaksR 0.3.0
In version 0.3.0, the pseudo-Voigt mixture model with a linear background model is available for peak fitting. This model enables background subtraction and peak fitting in the one-shot calculation. As the linear background is generally used in spectroscopy, the applicability of EMpeaksR packages is further expanded.


# EMpeaksR 0.2.0
In version 0.2.0, the following models are available for peak fitting: 
(1) Lorentz mixture model,
(2) pseudo-Voigt mixture model, 
(3) Doniach-Sunjic-Gauss mixture model. 
As these models are generally used in spectroscopy, applicability of EMpeaksR packages is expanded.


# EMpeaksR 0.1.0
This is new release.
